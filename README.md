# Cryptomarket

This project is a backend service built with [NestJS](http://nestjs.com/), designed to serve as the backbone for a marketplace platform that amalgamates concepts from Vinted and Shopify. It supports both private and public groups, catering to a broad range of use cases from casual sellers and buyers with shared interests to retail sellers focusing on their brands.

## Features

- **Public Groups:** Open for anyone to join, public groups are communities based around common interests. Members can contribute by adding items to the group, fostering a vibrant marketplace where unique finds and shared interests converge.

- **Private Groups:** Tailored for retail sellers, private groups offer an exclusive space for brand owners to showcase and sell their products. These groups serve as bespoke boutiques for brands seeking a dedicated audience.

- **Fully Tested:** The project places a high emphasis on reliability and maintainability, underscored by comprehensive unit and service tests. This ensures each component functions as expected, providing a solid foundation as the project scales.

- **Future Enhancements:** Planned expansions include integrating messaging and transaction flows to facilitate seamless interactions and transactions between users. Upon completion, the project will undergo extensive end-to-end and integration testing to guarantee a flawless user experience.

## Payment System with Stable Coins

A distinctive feature of this marketplace is its adoption of stable coins for transactions, promoting a secure and stable payment environment, without any need for third-parties or middle-man (such as banks). For more details on the payment system implementation, visit the dedicated repository:
